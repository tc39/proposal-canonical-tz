# Polyfill (for testing only) for TC39 Time Zone Canonicalization proposal

This polyfill is only for testing the TC39 [Time Zone Canonicalization proposal](..).
The sole purpose of this polyfill is to run [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) tests.
DO NOT use it in production!

It's created by stacking a handful of changes in this proposal on top of the [Temporal for-testing-only polyfill](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal).
